    HTML

</p><p class="s">This was the first language I had learnt back when I was new to designing. I have been working with HTML for more than six years, and have a good command over the language. I have designed almost all of my websites using a vast amount of HTML. HTML as a language acts as my support system.</p>

<p class="s">CSS

    Designing has always been my forte, since childhood I used to design logos, letterheads and what not. As websites and digital designing came into my life, HTML wasn't enough to create my way of beautiful websites, hence I started to learn CSS. It's been more than four years now since I had first used it</p>

I started learning this language as a project at one of my educational centres, but soon the language became one of my most preferred language.
